| Realtime Bridge Status: Get a feed of scheduled raising/lowering of the various bridges. And as well, a way to directly query the current state of each bridge. The service would include enough info so (for example) if a particular bridge is in the UP position, the data would reveal why. A dataset like this would support traffic routing apps and informational apps for people caught in traffic waiting for a bridge to be lowered. | [CivicApps idea](http://www.civicapps.org/ideas/realtime-bridge-status-feed-or-dataset) | ? | Scoping |
